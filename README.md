PartnerUp is a professional social media application designed to connect young adults together in order to create startups.
The target audience is primariy high school to college level students that major or have an interest/expertise in a certain field.
In the status quo, startups are growing exponentially, but one major boundary that young people face is not being able to finding the partners that match their interests or fit the requirements for their team.
This app allows students to connect themselves with people based on their location and field of interest/expertise in order to form startups or project teams.
